Revision history for Algorithm-Combinatorics

0.07 November 5 2005

    * Documented the corresponding formulas
    * Slicing is done now in Perl. The code is much more clear
      and in my benchmarks no significant difference is measured
    * The iterator now may receive an initial arrayref
      (this is private implementation), which simplifies the set
      up of the iterator when the first tuple is known

0.06 November 5 2005

    * permutations() is about 3-4 times faster

0.05  November 4 2005

    * Rewrote the test suite, and relevant documentation
    * Added the helper module t/Tester.pm
      to factor out a common test code pattern
    * If k is "out of natural range"" the empty set is returned
      and a warning is issued
    * The iterators return an arrayref, and the implementation
      was revised accordingly to be mathematically correct in
      edge-cases and more forgiving
    * I can't stand that DIAGNOSTICS::Errors section, so many
      croaks on boundary conditions are so unperlish! The module
      has just a couple of days so I am on time to fix this
